# LUMENYX

*In 2009, a few lines of code changed everything.*
*No company. No funding. No permission.*
*Just an idea: money that belongs to no one.*

We're building on that same principle.

## The Foundation

LUMENYX is not another token. It's a foundation.

A base layer where anyone can build anything.
DeFi. NFTs. Games. DAOs. Things we can't imagine yet.

But first, the foundation must be solid.

## Mining

Anyone can mine. No stake required. No validators. No permission.
```bash

cd lumenyx
cargo build --release
./target/release/lumenyx-node --chain mainnet --mine
```

That's it. You're mining.

## Genesis

> *"Banks ended up in the headlines. Today control over digital money sits in a few hands: founders, large holders, intermediaries and those who write the rules."*

This ends now.

---

The chain belongs to no one.

It's yours.

Build the future on it.

---

No company. No foundation. No website. No social media.

Just code.
