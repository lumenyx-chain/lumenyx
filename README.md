## A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

---

### Abstract

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash with fixed supply and smart contracts. The network uses proof-of-work consensus with 2.5 second blocks. Total supply is limited to 21,000,000 LUMENYX with a halving emission schedule. No governance, no team allocation, no venture capital.

---

### 1. Introduction

In 2009, Bitcoin proved that digital scarcity was possible.

In 2015, Ethereum proved that programmable money was possible.

LUMENYX combines both:

- Fixed supply (21,000,000)
- Smart contracts (EVM compatible)
- Fast blocks (2.5 seconds)
- True decentralization (fair launch)
- Zero governance (code is law)

---

### 2. Consensus

Proof of Work with LongestChain fork choice.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Block time | 2.5 seconds |
| Hash function | Blake3 |
| Fork choice | Longest chain |

Anyone with a computer can mine. No stake required. No permission needed.

---

### 3. Emission

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Initial reward | ~0.208 LUMENYX |
| Halving period | 4 years (50,492,160 blocks) |
| Total supply | 21,000,000 LUMENYX |

Timeline:
- Year 4: 50% mined (~10.5M)
- Year 8: 75% mined (~15.75M)
- Year 12: 87.5% mined (~18.4M)
- Year 16: 93.75% mined (~19.7M)

Same curve as Bitcoin. Proven model.

---

### 4. Smart Contracts

Full EVM compatibility. Deploy Solidity contracts without changes.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chain ID | 7777 |
| Gas model | Ethereum-compatible |

Everything built on Ethereum can be built on LUMENYX.

---

### 5. Transaction Fees

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Fee destination | 100% to miners |
| Min gas price | 45 planck/gas |
| Dynamic adjustment | ±10% per block |

Fees stay low. Even if LUMENYX reaches $1000, a simple transfer costs less than $0.001.

---

### 6. Distribution

- No premine
- No ICO
- No team allocation
- No foundation
- No venture capital

100% distributed through mining. Everyone starts equal.

---

### 7. Governance

None.

The code is the law. No admin keys. No sudo. No upgrades without hard fork.

Like Bitcoin, the protocol is set in stone. Only the community can change it through consensus.

---

### 8. What Can Be Built

The base layer is intentionally simple. Complexity belongs on top.

- Tokens (ERC-20)
- NFTs (ERC-721)
- Decentralized exchanges
- Lending protocols
- DAOs
- Games
- Layer 2 scaling solutions
- Privacy layers
- Bridges to other chains
- Things that don't exist yet

The foundation is yours. Build the future on it.

---

### 9. Conclusion

LUMENYX is digital cash for the next era:

- Scarce (21M cap)
- Fast (2.5 sec blocks)
- Programmable (EVM)
- Decentralized (PoW, no team)

No promises. No roadmap. No marketing.

Just code and consensus.

> *"Banks ended up in the headlines. Today control over digital money sits in a few hands: founders, large holders, intermediaries and those who write the rules."*

This ends now.

---

The chain belongs to no one.

It's yours.

Build the future on it.

---

No company. No foundation. No website. No social media.

Just code.
